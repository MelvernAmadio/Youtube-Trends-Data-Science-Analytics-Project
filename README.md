# YouTube Trending Video Analytics Project

This project is a comprehensive data science case study focused on uncovering patterns and insights from trending YouTube videos. Conducted as part of a collaborative learning initiative with Dibimbing, the project leverages a dataset from Kaggle containing over 160,000 video records from late 2017 to mid-2018, spanning four countries: the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Canada. The analysis aims to explore the dynamics behind video virality on YouTube by examining various performance metrics and content attributes.

Using Python and popular data science libraries, this project walks through the entire analytical workflow â€” from data preprocessing and cleaning, to exploratory data analysis (EDA), visual storytelling, and correlation exploration. The ultimate goal is to identify what drives video visibility and user engagement. These insights can empower content creators, marketers, and analysts to make informed, data-driven decisions when developing strategies for YouTube growth.
